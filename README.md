## Welcome, Warden!

You've found the little corner of the internet where we're trying to document the Prison Architect API.

There are two sections, really. Above, you can see a folder browser - in there we've dumped some of the game's main config files and images that are widely referred to when modding.

The bulk of the guide, however, is over in the wiki - you can get to it any time by clicking the little book icon in the sidebar, or just [click here](https://github.com/aubergine10/Prison-Architect-API/wiki).

:construction: This entire wiki is still heavily under constuction, just like the game.
